I am currently a Data Scientist in Lacework working on machine learning for cybersecurity. Before Lacework, I was a Principal Data Scientist at Zscaler, Data Engineering Tech Lead at Cisco, Lead Data Scientist at Misfit (acquired by Fossil Group), and Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
